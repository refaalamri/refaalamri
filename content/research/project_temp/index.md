#### Summary

My undergraduate thesis focused on identifying blue straggler star candidates that are more than twice as massive as the "main-sequence turn off" star. Blue straggler stars are main-sequence stars higher in luminosity and bluer than the average main sequence turn-off star in their associated clusters. They are an important conversation in astronomy because they challenge the preexisting stellar evolutionary models. Answering questions about their formation origins could alter, add or completely change the existing theory of stellar evolution. The study was conducted using the GAIA database to confirm the membership of the stars in several clusters.  Stellar isochrones were used to determine the mass of the blue straggler star and main sequence turn-off star. This study shows that blue straggler stars are prevalent in star clusters andd most of the blue straggler candidates found were almost twice as large as the main sequence turn-off star. The significant implications of these results indicate that ambiguity regarding the specific merger method of formation still exists.
